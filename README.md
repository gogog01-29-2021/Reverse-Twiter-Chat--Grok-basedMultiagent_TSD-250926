I want to change it into AI Agent that scrawl info that I designated into(Text, TImeseries, other formal und Informal Data) and summarize it into Database. Core functionality 1.from web browser I opned(chrome tabs and log,safari, 2.From my note 3.From my chatting log with chatGPT,Gemini,kimi) and from my local storage it should "self motivately explore and get info to DB and based on primary DB it should plan things and based on plan in second DB crawl it. and it should be interact with me. while doing it if I want"

# AI Agent for Autonomous Information Crawling & Summarization

An AI-powered agent platform that autonomously crawls, summarizes, and organizes information from multiple sources into a structured database.  
The agent is designed to interact with you, plan its actions, and continuously expand its knowledge base.

## 🌟 Core Functionalities

1. **Multi-Source Crawling**
   - **Web Browser Integration**: Automatically gathers information from open browser tabs (Chrome, Safari), browsing history, and logs.
   - **Personal Notes**: Extracts and summarizes content from your notes.
   - **Chat Logs**: Collects conversations from ChatGPT, Gemini, Kimi, and other chat platforms.
   - **Local Storage**: Explores files and data on your local machine.

2. **Data Types Supported**
   - Text (articles, notes, chats)
   - Time Series (logs, activity data)
   - Formal & Informal Data (structured/unstructured)

3. **Autonomous Exploration & Planning**
   - The agent self-motivates to discover new information and update the primary database.
   - Based on the primary DB, it plans further crawling and exploration, storing plans and results in a secondary DB.

4. **Interactive & Adaptive**
   - You can interact with the agent at any time to guide, pause, or redirect its actions.
   - The agent adapts its crawling and summarization strategy based on your feedback and new data.

## 🚀 Example Workflow

1. **Crawl**: Agent scans your browser, notes, chat logs, and local files for new information.
2. **Summarize**: Extracted data is summarized and stored in a primary database.
3. **Plan**: Agent analyzes the database, creates a plan for deeper exploration, and stores this in a secondary database.
4. **Act**: Follows the plan to gather more targeted information.
5. **Interact**: You can view, modify, or add instructions at any step.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

_(Setup instructions remain the same as before. Update as your implementation evolves.)_

> **Tip:**  
> As you implement, update the README with specific setup, configuration, and usage instructions for each data source and agent capability.
